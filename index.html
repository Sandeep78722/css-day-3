                <span> personification of an ideal leader and a man who knows no fear... That is YS Rajasekhara Reddy for you...</span> Wherever he went, barren lands turned into lush green fertile lands. His commitment to agriculture was complete and unadulterated. Even when ‘Know All’ babus wanted agriculture to be consigned to dustbin, YSR wanted the lives of farmers to bloom. His life is a classic text book case of service, commitment. 
                
                He was kind when it came to the poor and fierce on his enemies. He has managed to bring in such innovative welfare schemes that no other person could imagine. It was through these innovative service and welfare schemes that he is remembered today by the Telugus.</p>

            <h3>n.chandra babu naidu</h3>
            <p><span>chandhra Naidu is a Indian politician and the former chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.</span> He is the national president of Telugu Desam Party. Chandrababu Naidu is currently the leader of the opposition in the Andhra Pradesh assembly.Active in college politics, Chandrababu Naidu earned his political spurs early. He began his political career as a member of the Youth Congress Party in the 1970s and was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in 1978. He served as the Minister for Rural Development during 1983-1989.

                In 1995, after a coup of sorts, Naidu took over the post of chief minister of Andhra Pradesh from his father-in-law, NT Rama Rao. On October 11, 1999, he was sworn in as the chief minister for a second term. He served as the Chief Minister for two consecutive terms, from 1995 to 2004. He is the first chief minister who served for the longest time in Andhra Pradesh.

            <h3>y.s jagan</h3>
            <p><span> Congress chief Yeduguri Sandinti Jaganmohan Reddy was sworn-in on May 30, 2019 as the second Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh post its bifurcation.</span>

                The YSR Congress bagged 151 of the 175 seats in the state Assembly in 2019, decimating the TDP headed by N Chandrababu Naidu, who became the first chief minister of the state after it was bifurcated to carve out Telangana five years ago.
                
                YSRC won 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats. The win must have also been sweet for another reason. It also signified the continuous free fall in Andhra Pradesh of the Congress (down to 1.29% vote share from 40.72% in 2009) — the party that cast aside Jagan, setting him off on his solitary path.
                
                In its internal calculations, the YSRCP had thought it would get 100-110 seats out of 175 in the recent Assembly polls. With 2014 in mind, when it had expected to win but was bested by Naidu, it also kept expectations low. The final tally of 151 constituencies, plus 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats, surprised even them, admits a senior YSRCP MLA. “We did not anticipate such huge silent support for Jagan.”</p>
